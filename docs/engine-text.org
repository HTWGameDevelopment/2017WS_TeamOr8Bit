* Text rendering in our engine
** Static Text
   For rendering static text, generate a grey-scaled bitmap of the entire text
   and upload it as a texture. Then render with a default text rectangle.
** Dynamic Text
*** Glyphmap
    Everytime a dynamic text wants to render a previously unused glyph:
    1. Create a bitmap of the glyph.
    2. Add the bitmap to a large glyph texture.
    =GL_MAX_RECTANGLE_TEXTURE_SIZE= is =16384= which means 512*512 32px glyphs
    can be stored; more than enough for every language.
*** Render
    Render each glyph individually and update UV for glyphmap access.
** Components
*** Font (see freetype2)
*** Glyphmap (in engine)
*** HUD for managing coordinates
