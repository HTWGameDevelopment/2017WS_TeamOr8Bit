\section{Game Flow Summary}
A player starts a game from the main menu after selecting a level and choosing an opponent (Computer or Online).
After the level has been loaded, the players are taking turns playing the map. More specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moving their units.
    \item Making their units attack something.
    \item Taking over buildings.
    \item Placing buildings.
\end{itemize}
This basic gameplay loop is maintained throughout the game; variations in
gameplay come from each player's tactics and strategy.
