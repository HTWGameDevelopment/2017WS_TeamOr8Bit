\part{Levels}

If within our time frame, there will be a campaign with multiple maps. We can only guarantee one map at launch.
\section{Level 1 - Dam Level}
\label{level}
Symmetrical map with bases and units \index{unit} and a ,,dam'' and river flowing through the middle, splitting the map into two faction halves.
The dam consists of three bases which, if captured, give the controlling faction the ability to flood the riverbed and destroy every base
or unit \index{unit} in its path. This is a one-time ability and must be the only action done in that move. The rest will be plains and forests for simplicity.
