\section{Visual System}
\subsection{HUD}
The HUD is minimalistic and only features a clickable minimap and round stats, e.g.
a clock, round number and a metric rating each player (the total hp of all buildings \index{building}).
\subsection{Menus}
Units and buildings \index{building} have a main action, usually attacking, and secondary actions available
through a right-click menu.
\subsection{Camera}
The camera is a perspective camera with full 3D-movement. Rotates around the lookat center.
\subsection{Lighting Models}
For simplicity and easily distinguishable gameplay components, we will use simple phong shading
for every component.

\begin{itemize}
