\section{Visual System}
\subsection{HUD} %TODO
The HUD is minimalistic and only features a clickable minimap and round stats, e.g.
a clock, round number and a metric rating each player (the total hp of all buildings).
\subsection{Menus} %TODO
Units and buildings have a main action, usually attacking, and secondary actions available
through a right-click menu.
\subsection{Camera} %TODO
The camera is a perspective camera with full 3D-movement. Rotates around the lookat center.
\subsection{Lighting Models} %TODO
For simplicity and easily distinguishable gameplay components, we will use simple phong shading
for every component.
\section{Control System} %TODO
The game features rebindable keys and input functions for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Movement.
    \item Camera controls.
    \item Shortcuts to POI.
\end{itemize}
\section{Music} %TODO
\section{Sound Effects} %TODO
\section{Help System} %TODO
If within our time frame, we intend to add an offline guide-book for distribution with the game.
